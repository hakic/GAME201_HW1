# GAME201 HW1

Implemented explicit and implicit euler of **mass spring**.

Explicit euler, implemented
* Forward euler
* RK2
* RK3
* RK4

Implicit euler, implemented
* Backward euler with jacobi iteration (#iteration=20)

More details:
* Code was based on **mass_spring_explicit.py** example.
* Moved "Collide with ground" to after "Compute new position" because my explicit code updates *x* and *v* at the same time (I didn't know the difference)
* Didn't know how to compute gradient in implicit euler. Used auto-grad in **taichi** to compute the gradient.
* Settings:
  * #particles = 10
  * damping = 20.0
  * dt = 1e-3

Comparsion
\ |Forward Euler | RK2 | RK3 | RK4 | implicit euler
---- | ----- | ------ | ---- | ---- | --------
latency per step | ~0.4ms | ~0.5ms | ~0.6ms | ~0.6ms | ~5m (~3m w/o auto-grad computing time)
energy stableness **\*** | 0.92 | 0.92 | 0.92 | 0.90 | 0.98
max spring stiffness | 7,500 | 45,000 | 300,000 | 500,000 | ~300,000 (similar value for #iteration=50)

**\*** energy (mgh + mv^2 / 2 + kÎ”x^2 / 2) stableness = moving average rate of (energy at step **t** / energy at step **t-100**) after the movement of springs becomes small and before the spring hits the ground.

Fun facts:
* First time to use github
* First physics simulation program
